# 0x19-Postmortem

## Overview

The `0x19-postmortem` project is designed to document and analyze critical incidents that occur during the development and deployment process of a software project. The goal of this postmortem is to identify the root cause of issues, outline the timeline of events, and propose corrective actions to prevent similar incidents in the future. By performing a thorough postmortem, we aim to improve our processes and enhance the overall stability and reliability of our systems.

## Objectives

1. **Incident Documentation**: Provide a clear and detailed description of the incident, including when it happened, what went wrong, and its impact on the users and the system.
2. **Root Cause Analysis**: Identify the underlying causes that led to the incident. This involves digging deep to find out why the problem occurred and how it could have been prevented.
3. **Corrective Measures**: Propose actionable steps that can be taken to prevent similar issues in the future. This includes implementing new processes, improving existing systems, or enhancing testing procedures.
4. **Learning and Improvement**: Ensure that the team learns from the incident and applies this knowledge to future projects to avoid repeating the same mistakes.

## Structure

The postmortem for this project is structured into the following sections:

1. **Incident Summary**: A brief overview of the incident, including when it occurred and what went wrong.
2. **Timeline**: A detailed timeline of events leading up to the incident, during the incident, and after the incident.
3. **Root Cause**: An analysis of the root cause(s) that led to the incident.
4. **Resolution**: A description of how the issue was resolved.
5. **Corrective Actions**: A list of actions that will be taken to prevent similar incidents in the future.
6. **Conclusion**: A summary of the key takeaways and lessons learned from the incident.

## Example Postmortem

The project includes an example postmortem that walks through a real-world scenario. This example outlines a feature deployment that resulted in user login failures and details the steps taken to identify and resolve the issue. The example also highlights key corrective actions to improve the process going forward.
